    <h2>What is ML?</h2>
    <p> <blockquote> [Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. —Arthur Samuel, 1959 </blockquote>

       A more engineering-oriented one:
       <blockquote>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.  -- Tom Mitchell, 1997
       </blockquote>

    <h2>Types of Machine Learning Systems</h2>
    <p> Classified according to the <strong> amount and type of supervision </strong> they get during training. There are four major categories: 
      <ol>
        <li>supervised</li>
        <li>unsupervised</li>
        <li>semisupervised</li>
        <li>reinforcement (强化学习)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
    <p>
       The training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called <i>labels</i>.

       </figure>
    </p>


    <h3>Unsupervised Learning </h3>
    <p>
      A related task is <b>dimensionality reduction</b>(降维), in which the goal is to simplify the data without losing too much information.
